ABSTRACT

This research explores the application of advanced machine learning techniques in financial market analytics, focusing on sentiment-driven stock price prediction through a comprehensive analysis of financial news and historical market trends. The study employs a hybrid deep learning architecture, integrating FinBERT for sentiment extraction with an Attention-based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to enhance predictive accuracy and model market behavior effectively.

Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as tokenization, contextual embedding, and sentiment classification, the model extracts meaningful insights from financial news and social media narratives. The FinBERT component captures domain-specific sentiment, while the Attention-LSTM processes sequential market data, emphasizing critical trends and sentiment shifts influencing stock price movements. This approach enhances interpretability and improves the model’s ability to correlate investor sentiment with market fluctuations.

The proposed model achieved a high cross-validation accuracy of 92.3%, with a low standard deviation of 1.65%, demonstrating its robustness in forecasting stock price trends based on sentiment-driven market dynamics. Key innovations include adaptive learning rate optimization, multi-modal feature integration, and class weight balancing, ensuring scalability and performance across diverse financial datasets. This research provides a promising framework for intelligent stock market prediction, bridging the gap between unstructured financial text and precise price forecasting through state-of-the-art FinBERT and Attention-LSTM computational techniques.

•	Data Ingestion: Collects data from multiple sources, including stock market APIs, financial news platforms, and social media, ensuring a diverse and comprehensive dataset for analysis.
•	Storage: Aggregates raw data into a centralized data lake, facilitating efficient management and retrieval of historical and real-time financial information.
•	Data Preparation: Executes ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, cleaning and transforming financial text data. This step includes tokenization, lemmatization, sentiment scoring using FinBERT, and structuring data for deep learning models.
•	Analytics and Prediction: Processes structured data through the LSTM model, integrating historical price trends and sentiment analysis results to forecast stock price movements accurately.

1.	The graph shows predicted stock prices over the next 60 days using your AI model (likely LSTM + FinBERT).
2.	The Y-axis represents the predicted stock price, and the X-axis shows the day number (from 0 to 60).
3.	The blue line with dots indicates significant fluctuations in predicted prices, showing both rises and sharp drops — reflecting real market volatility.
4.	The model captures short-term trends well, suggesting it's sensitive to sentiment-based signals, though the high variation may imply market uncertainty or data sensitivity.

1.	Mean Squared Error (MSE): 105764.79
This measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual stock prices. A lower MSE means better predictions. While the value seems large, it depends on the price scale — for high-value stocks, this may still be acceptable.

2.	Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 325.21
This is the square root of MSE, and it's in the same units as the stock prices. On average, your model's predictions are off by about ₹325, which gives a practical idea of prediction error.

3.	R² Score: 0.8664
Also called the coefficient of determination, it shows how well the model explains the variance in the data. A score of 0.86 is quite strong — it means 86.64% of the variation in stock prices is captured by your model.

4.	Model Accuracy: 86.64%
This indicates your model’s overall prediction accuracy. An accuracy of 86.64% is very good for stock price forecasting, especially given how volatile and non-linear market data can be.

1.	Blue Line (Actual Prices): Represents the true stock prices over time in your training dataset.
2.	Orange Line (Predicted Prices): Shows the prices predicted by your hybrid model (LSTM + FinBERT).
3.	The lines follow a similar trend, indicating that your model has effectively captured the key patterns and fluctuations in stock price movement.
4.	There are minor deviations in some areas, but the model generally tracks both upward and downward trends well, showing strong learning performance.
5.	This visualization confirms that your model is well-fitted to training data, which aligns with the high R² score and accuracy shown earlier.
